# Noise Meter Auto Report App

The Noise Meter Auto Report App is an Android application designed to address the issue of noise pollution and contribute to creating a quieter environment. This app provides users with the ability to monitor noise levels, set thresholds, automatically detect their current address location, and record noise level incidents. It aims to empower users to take control of their surroundings and contribute to the campaign to mitigate noise pollution, particularly in Toronto.

## Features

1. **Ease of Use:** The app offers a user-friendly interface, making it simple and intuitive for users to navigate and utilize its features.

2. **Noise Level Monitoring:** With the app's noise level monitoring feature, users can actively track the noise levels in their environment in decibels (dB).

3. **Threshold Setting:** Users have the option to set a noise level threshold. When the noise levels exceed this threshold, the app will trigger an incident recording.

4. **Automatic Address Detection:** The app utilizes GPS technology to automatically detect and record the user's current address location. This information provides context to noise level incidents.

5. **Incident Recording:** When the detected noise level surpasses the set threshold, the app records a noise level incident. Each incident includes a timestamp, the address location at the time of the incident, and the detected noise level.

6. **Android Version:** The app is designed specifically for Android devices, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of smartphones and tablets.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, the Noise Meter Auto Report App is poised to offer even more features and functionality to further address noise pollution:

- **Noise Source Identification:** The app will support users in identifying the source of noise, such as modified vehicles, construction sites, railroads, aircraft, and animals. This enhancement will enable users to better understand the nature of the noise pollution.

- **Incident Submission to Backend Server:** The app's upcoming feature will allow users to submit recorded noise level incidents to a backend server. This centralized data collection will aid in analysis and decision-making for noise pollution mitigation efforts.

- **Comprehensive Noise Measurements:** The app will incorporate dBA (A-weighted decibels) and dBZ (Z-weighted decibels) measurements, offering a more comprehensive understanding of noise levels. This enhancement will provide users with more detailed information about the quality and characteristics of the noise they are exposed to.

- **iOS Version:** As the final enhancement, the app will be extended to iOS devices, expanding its reach and impact to a wider user base.
